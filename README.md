# E-commerce Sales Analysis

Data analysis project using SQL and Power BI: exploring e-commerce sales, customer behavior, product trends, and order performance.

## Goals

This project helps to better understand key aspects of e-commerce performance, such as:

- sales results â€“ total number of orders, revenue, and profit
- customer profile â€“ who the buyers are and where they are from
- order process â€“ how often orders are returned or canceled
- product and brand results â€“ which items bring the most money

These insights can support better decisions in marketing, product planning, and overall business strategy.

## Project Structure

- `01_general_metrics/`: Total orders (success/unsusses counts), total revenue and profit, average order value  
- `02_user_analysis/`: Customer geography, new users by month  
- `03_order_analysis/`: Return rate by country, users groups, category
- `04_product_analysis/`: Top categories, top brands, top products and margin  
- `data/`: Raw CSV files used in this project
- `power_bi/`: Interactive dashboard file in `.pbix` format. You can download and explore the full Power BI dashboard used in this project.
- `screenshots/`: Exported visualizations used in the report summary. Each screenshot corresponds to a key analysis block and is referenced in the summary report.
- `summary.md`: Final report with key findings. Links to screenshots are included for clarity.

## Dashboard and Visualizations

The interactive Power BI dashboard (`Dashboard.pbix`) is located in the `powerbi/` folder.  
Key screenshots of each report page  is located in the `screenshots/` folder.

You can explore visual insights from:
- General sales metrics
- User behavior and new customer trends
- Order performance and return patterns
- Product and brand profitability
