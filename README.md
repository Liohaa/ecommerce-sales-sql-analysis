# E-commerce Sales Analysis

Data analysis project using SQL and Power BI: exploring e-commerce sales, customer behavior, product trends, and order performance.

## Goals

To help the business understand:  
- how much it sells,  
- who the customers are,  
- how well orders are delivered,  
- and which products, brands generate the most revenue and profit.

This can help the company improve sales, marketing, and products.

## Project Structure

- `01_general_metrics/`: Total orders (success/unsusses counts), total revenue and profit, average order value  
- `02_user_analysis/`: Customer geography, new users by month  
- `03_order_analysis/`: Return rate by country, users groups, category
- `04_product_analysis/`: Top categories, top brands, top products and margin  
- `data/`: Raw CSV files used in this project

## Dashboard and Visualizations

The interactive Power BI dashboard (`Dashboard.pbix`) is located in the `powerbi/` folder.  
Key screenshots of each report page  is located in the `powerbi/screenshots/` folder.

You can explore visual insights from:
- General sales metrics
- User behavior and new customer trends
- Order performance and return patterns
- Product and brand profitability
